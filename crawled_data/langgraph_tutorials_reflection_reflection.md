# Reflection[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#reflection "Permanent link")

In the context of LLM agent building, reflection refers to the process of prompting an LLM to observe its past steps (along with potential observations from tools/the environment) to assess the quality of the chosen actions. This is then used downstream for things like re-planning, search, or evaluation.

![Reflection]()

This notebook demonstrates a very simple form of reflection in LangGraph.

[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-1)Title: The Eternal Relevance of The Little Prince in Modern Childhood
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-2)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-3)Introduction:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-4)Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince is a timeless novella that has captured the hearts and minds of children and adults alike for over seven decades. Its enduring charm and profound wisdom have transcended generations, making it a classic staple in childhood literature. This essay explores the reasons why The Little Prince remains relevant in modern childhood.
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-5)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-6)First Paragraph:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-7)One of the primary reasons for The Little Prince's relevance is its exploration of themes that resonate with children today. The story addresses universal aspects of childhood, such as the struggle to understand the world, the desire for friendship and love, and the pain of loss and loneliness. The Little Prince's encounters with various grown-ups, each representing different facets of adult absurdity, mirror the confusion and disillusionment children experience as they grow and navigate their way through a complex world.
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-8)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-9)Second Paragraph:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-10)Moreover, The Little Prince promotes values that are essential for modern childhood. It emphasizes the importance of imagination, creativity, and curiosity, encouraging children to question, explore, and seek their own truths. The Little Prince's friendship with the fox teaches children about the value of emotional connections, empathy, and responsibility, lessons that are increasingly vital in our technology-driven, fast-paced society.
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-11)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-12)Third Paragraph:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-13)The Little Prince also serves as a reminder of the significance of nature and the environment in our lives. The story's depiction of the desert, the baobabs, and the mysterious asteroid B-612 fosters an appreciation for the beauty and fragility of the natural world. In an era of climate change and environmental degradation, The Little Prince's message about the importance of nurturing and preserving our planet is more relevant than ever.
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-14)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-15)Fourth Paragraph:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-16)Furthermore, The Little Prince offers a unique perspective on mental health and emotional well-being. The story delicately tackles issues such as depression, isolation, and the search for meaning, providing a nuanced understanding of these complex topics. By presenting these themes in a relatable and age-appropriate manner, The Little Prince helps children develop emotional intelligence and resilience, enabling them to better cope with the challenges they face in their daily lives.
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-17)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-18)Conclusion:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-4-19)In conclusion, The Little Prince remains a relevant and essential read for modern childhood due to its exploration of timeless themes, promotion of essential values, emphasis on nature and environmental stewardship, and sensitive treatment of mental health and emotional well-being. By engaging with this classic tale, children can gain invaluable insights and skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. The Little Prince's enduring legacy is a testament to its ability to captivate, inspire, and educate generations of children, making it an indispensable part of childhood literature.

While it might be easy to dismiss this work as a children\'s story, its profound themes and timeless message make it a relevant and topical piece in modern life. This essay will explore the allegorical nature of "The Little Prince," analyze the psychological and societal consequences of neglecting its message, and discuss its critique of modern society, demonstrating its topicality in contemporary life.\n\nBody Paragraph 1 - The Allegory of the Little Prince:\n"The Little Prince" is an allegorical tale that uses whimsical characters and situations to explore various aspects of the human condition. The Little Prince himself represents innocence, curiosity, and the importance of human connection, but he also embodies the capacity for growth and self-discovery. As the story unfolds, readers encounter different characters that symbolize various aspects of adult life, such as vanity, materialism, and authority. For instance, the king represents authority without substance, while the businessman embodies the futility of materialism. The fox, conversely, symbolizes the importance of forming genuine connections and nurturing meaningful relationships. These allegorical representations allow the story to transcend age and culture, making it relatable to a wide range of readers, even in the modern context.\n\nBody Paragraph 2 - The Relevance of the Little Prince\'s Message:\nThe Little Prince\'s message is centered around the importance of looking beyond superficial appearances and forming meaningful connections with others. In a world increasingly dominated by technology and social media, where surface-level interactions are commonplace, this message is more relevant than ever. Neglecting this message can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and dissatisfaction, which can have significant impacts on mental and physical health. Research has shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and heart disease (Holt-Lunstad, 2015). By embracing the story\'s wisdom, we can prioritize genuine relationships, fostering a more compassionate and interconnected society.\n\nBody Paragraph 3 - The Critique of Modern Society:\n"The Little Prince" offers a critique of modern society, highlighting the dangers of materialism, consumerism, and the pursuit of power. Materialism and consumerism contribute to wealth inequality and environmental degradation by promoting unsustainable practices and exacerbating social and economic disparities. For instance, the overconsumption of resources leads to deforestation, climate change, and the exploitation of marginalized communities (Jackson, 2017). To address these challenges, we must reevaluate our priorities, focusing on sustainability, empathy, and the cultivation of meaningful relationships.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, "The Little Prince" remains a topical and relevant work in modern life due to its allegorical nature, timeless message, and critique of modern society.

[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-121)
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-122)Introduction:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-123)Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's "The Little Prince" is a timeless novella that has captured the hearts of millions since its publication in 1943. While it might be easy to dismiss this work as a children's story, its profound themes and timeless message make it a relevant and topical piece in modern life. This essay will explore the allegorical nature of "The Little Prince," analyze the psychological and societal consequences of neglecting its message, and discuss its critique of modern society, demonstrating its topicality in contemporary life.

[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-125)Body Paragraph 1 - The Allegory of the Little Prince:
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-126)"The Little Prince" is an allegorical tale that uses whimsical characters and situations to explore various aspects of the human condition. The Little Prince himself represents innocence, curiosity, and the importance of human connection, but he also embodies the capacity for growth and self-discovery. As the story unfolds, readers encounter different characters that symbolize various aspects of adult life, such as vanity, materialism, and authority. For instance, the king represents authority without substance, while the businessman embodies the futility of materialism. The fox, conversely, symbolizes the importance of forming genuine connections and nurturing meaningful relationships. These allegorical representations allow the story to transcend age and culture, making it relatable to a wide range of readers, even in the modern context.

[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#__codelineno-16-129)The Little Prince's message is centered around the importance of looking beyond superficial appearances and forming meaningful connections with others. In a world increasingly dominated by technology and social media, where surface-level interactions are commonplace, this message is more relevant than ever. Neglecting this message can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and dissatisfaction, which can have significant impacts on mental and physical health. Research has shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and heart disease (Holt-Lunstad, 2015). By embracing the story's wisdom, we can prioritize genuine relationships, fostering a more compassionate and interconnected society.

## Conclusion[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflection/reflection/#conclusion "Permanent link")

Now that you've applied reflection to an LLM agent, I'll note one thing: self-reflection is inherently cyclic: it is much more effective if the reflection step has additional context or feedback (from tool observations, checks, etc.). If, like in the scenario above, the reflection step simply prompts the LLM to reflect on its output, it can still benefit the output quality (since the LLM then has multiple "shots" at getting a good output), but it's less guaranteed.
