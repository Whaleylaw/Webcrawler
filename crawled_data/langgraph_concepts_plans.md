# LangGraph Platform Plans[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/plans/#langgraph-platform-plans "Permanent link")

## Overview[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/plans/#overview "Permanent link")

LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production. There are three different plans for using it.

  * **Developer** : All [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) users have access to this plan. You can sign up for this plan simply by creating a LangSmith account. This gives you access to the [Self-Hosted Lite](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/#self-hosted-lite) deployment option.
  * **Plus** : All [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) users with a [Plus account](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/administration/pricing) have access to this plan. You can sign up for this plan simply by upgrading your LangSmith account to the Plus plan type. This gives you access to the [Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/#cloud-saas) deployment option.
  * **Enterprise** : This is separate from LangSmith plans. You can sign up for this plan by contacting sales@langchain.dev. This gives you access to all deployment options: [Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/#cloud-saas), [Bring-Your-Own-Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/#bring-your-own-cloud), and [Self Hosted Enterprise](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/#self-hosted-enterprise)
