# Time Travel ‚è±Ô∏è[¬∂](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#time-travel "Permanent link")

Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you are familiar with LangGraph's checkpoints and states. If not, please review the [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) concept first.

When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:

  1. ü§î **Understand Reasoning** : Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.
  2. üêû **Debug Mistakes** : Identify where and why errors occurred.
  3. üîç **Explore Alternatives** : Test different paths to uncover better solutions.



We call these debugging techniques **Time Travel** , composed of two key actions: [**Replaying**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#replaying) üîÅ and [**Forking**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#forking) üîÄ .

## Replaying[¬∂](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#replaying "Permanent link")

![](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/img/human_in_the_loop/replay.png)

Replaying allows us to revisit and reproduce an agent's past actions, up to and including a specific step (checkpoint).

To replay actions before a specific checkpoint, start by retrieving all checkpoints for the thread:

```
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-0-1)all_checkpoints = []
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-0-2)for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-0-3)  all_checkpoints.append(state)

```


Each checkpoint has a unique ID. After identifying the desired checkpoint, for instance, `xyz`, include its ID in the configuration:

```
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-1-1)config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xyz'}}
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-1-2)for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-1-3)  print(event)

```


The graph replays previously executed steps _before_ the provided `checkpoint_id` and executes the steps _after_ `checkpoint_id` (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously.

## Forking[¬∂](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#forking "Permanent link")

![](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/img/human_in_the_loop/forking.png)

Forking allows you to revisit an agent's past actions and explore alternative paths within the graph.

To edit a specific checkpoint, such as `xyz`, provide its `checkpoint_id` when updating the graph's state:

```
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-2-1)config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "xyz"}}
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-2-2)graph.update_state(config, {"state": "updated state"})

```


This creates a new forked checkpoint, xyz-fork, from which you can continue running the graph:

```
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-3-1)config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xyz-fork'}}
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-3-2)for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/#__codelineno-3-3)  print(event)

```
